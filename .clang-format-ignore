# the .clang-format-ignore file is only respected by version 18 or newer of
# clang-format (earlier versions will simply ignore the file)

# List of Vendored External source files
# --------------------------------------
# Since the following source files are copy-pasted from an external library
# that we could link against (instead of embedding the files), we should make
# sure to prevent clang-format from modifying the files
src/External/pngconf.h
src/External/pngwriter.cpp
src/External/pngwriter.h

# List of generated parsing-files
# -------------------------------
# Skip the following files because they have been auto-generated by flex/bison
# (if we didn't check them into the VCS, these would be skipped automatically)
src/Cello/lex.yy.c
src/Cello/parse.tab.c
src/Cello/parse.tab.h

# Header files included within fortran source code
# ------------------------------------------------
src/Enzo/fortran_types.h
