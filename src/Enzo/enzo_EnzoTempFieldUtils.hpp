  /// This solution is somewhat inelegant. Ideally in the future, public use of
  /// these functions will be replaced with a Context Manager Class whose
  /// lifetime is coupled to the allocation and deallocation of reused
  /// temporary fields (OR local temporary fields are not used).

  /// Allocates a frequently reused temporary field
  ///
  /// If the field was not previously created it is inserted into
  /// field.field_descr. If the field_name matches the name of the permanent
  /// field, then nothing happens.
  ///
  /// @param field Field object that will hold the allocated temporary field
  /// @param field_name The name of the temporary field to allocate
  /// @param cx,cy,cz The centering of the temporary field to allocate

  /// @param field Field object that holds the temporary fields to be
  ///     deallocated
  /// @param group_names Vector of group names that indicates which groups the
  ///     fields that should be deallocated are a part of.
  /// @param grouping Together with group_names, this specified which temporary
  ///     fields should be deallocated.
