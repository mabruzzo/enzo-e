  ///     advected scalars that may be included. (If a group is listed here but
  ///     the Grouping object doesn't actually provide any fields in the group,
  ///     no problems are caused)

  ///     reconstructed face-centered integrable primitives. This should be
  ///     face-centered along `dim` (without having values on the exterior
  ///     faces of the block) and cell-centered along the other dimensions. 
  /// @param[in]     pressure_array_l,pressure_array_r Arrays holding the
  ///     precomputed left/right reconstructed pressure values. These should
  ///     have the same face-centering as the arrays in priml_map/primr_map.
  /// @param[out]    flux_map Holds arrays where the calculated fluxes
  ///     will be stored. The arrays should be face-centered along `dim`
  ///     (without having values on the exterior faces of the block)
  /// @param[in]     dim Dimension along which to compute Riemann fluxes.
  ///     Values of 0, 1, and 2 correspond to the x, y, and z directions.
  /// @param[in]     eos Instance of the fluid's EnzoEquationOfState object
  /// @param[in]     stale_depth indicates the current stale_depth.
  /// @param[in]     passive_lists A list of lists of keys for passively
  ///     advected scalars. The first list holds the keys for quantities that
  ///     are normally passively advected. Subsequent lists group together
  ///     collections of passively advected scalars whose specific value
  ///     (before and after advection) must sum to 1. Keys must not be
  ///     duplicated across more than one list.
  /// @param[in,out] interface_velocity Pointer to an array to hold the
  ///     computed component of the velocity at the cell interfaces along
  ///     `dim` (the array should not include exterior faces of the block and
  ///     should be cell-centered along other dimensions). This quantity is
  ///     used to compute the internal energy source term (needed under the
  ///     dual energy formalism). If the value is `NULL`, then the interface
  ///     velocity is not stored in the array.
  ///
  /// @note It's alright for arrays in `priml_map` and `primr_map` to have the
  /// shapes of cell-centered arrays. In this case, the function effectively
  /// treats such arrays as if their `subarray` method were invoked, where
  /// `CSlice(0,-1)` is specified for the `dim` axis and
  /// `CSlice(nullptr,nullptr)` is specified for other axes. This logic also
  /// applies to the other arrays passed as arguments.
