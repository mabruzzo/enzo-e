  ///     advected scalars that may be included. (If a group is listed here but
  ///     the Grouping object doesn't actually provide any fields in the group,
  ///     no problems are caused)

  ///     reconstructed face-centered integrable primitives are stored. The
  ///     relevant fields should be formally defined as cell-centered (to allow
  ///     for reuse). During the calculation, they are treated as face-centered
  ///     (without having values on the exterior faces of the block). As a
  ///     result, there is some unused space at the end of the arrays.
  /// @param pressure_name_l,pressure_name_r are the names of the fields
  ///     storing the left/right pressure values that have already been
  ///     computed from the reconstructed values. The face-centering is expected
  ///     to match fields contained by priml_group, primr_group
  /// @param flux_group holds field names where the calculated fluxes will be
  ///     stored. The relevant fields should be face-centered along the
  ///     dimension of the calculation (without having values on the exterior
  ///     faces of the block)
  /// @param dim Dimension along which to compute Riemann fluxes. Values of 0,
  ///     1, and 2 correspond to the x, y, and z directions, respectively.
  /// @param eos Instance of the fluid's EnzoEquationOfState object
  /// @param stale_depth indicates the number of field entries from the
  ///     outermost field value that the region including "stale" values (need
  ///     to be refreshed) extends over (0 means there are no "stale" values).
  /// @param interface_velocity_name indicates the name of field where the
  ///     value of the interface velocity along dimension `dim` should be
  ///     stored. This quantity is used to compute the internal energy source
  ///     term (needed under the dual energy formalism). If the value is `""`
  ///     (the default) then the interface velocity is not stored.
