  /// @ingroup  Enzo
  /// @brief    [\ref Enzo] Encapsulates operations of constrained transport
  ///
  /// Instances of this class are meant to be used as components of an MHD or
  /// hydrodynamical integrators that are entirely responsible for all
  /// constrained-transport related operations that would not otherwise be
  /// performed by the solver. The distinction between whether a pointer is
  /// NULL or points to an instance of this class should entirely dictate
  /// whether constrained-transport related operations are used in the
  /// integrator.
  ///
  /// To accomplish these goals, this object is responsible for the
  /// allocation/deallocation of the required temporary scratch-space
  /// and providing the actual constrained transport operations. To manage
  /// scratch-space in a thread-safe manner (i.e. allocating/deallocating it
  /// separately for each block) while avoiding two-step constructing and
  /// destruction of instances of this class, the temporary scratch-space
  /// arrays are implemented as temporary fields that are allocated/deallocated
  /// in the class's constructor/destructor. As a consequence, instances of
  /// this class need to be constructed and destroyed separately for each leaf
  /// block during every cycle that the underlying MHD integrator is applied.
  /// The instance also internally tracks the current partial timestep to be
  /// less intrusive for the underlying MHD integrator.
  ///
  /// Although this design is crude, it is simple. The design could be improved
  /// by making separating the responsiblities of the allocation/deallocation
  /// of temporary scratch space and the implementation of the constrained
  /// transport operation between two classes. However this refactoring has
  /// been defered to the future when other classes may be introduced to
  /// encapsulate other approaches to updated the magnetic field (e.g. Dedner
  /// divergence cleaning).
